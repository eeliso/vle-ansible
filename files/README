# Place configuration files here that you want to distribute to servers.
# Reference them by filename in inventory.yml under each host's `config_files` list.
#
# Example:
#   files/sshd_config      -> pushed to Linux hosts listing "sshd_config"
#   files/nginx.conf       -> pushed to Linux hosts listing "nginx.conf"
#   files/logon_banner.txt -> pushed to Windows hosts listing "logon_banner.txt"
